# Movie_Prediction

We have arranged the data and assigned dummies to Actors and directors. Additionally, we have changed the data types to make it suitable for calculations. We have tried linear regression but that is not fitting well with the data with a low R squared value. So further, we have tried andom forest regression for better results. The results have indeed improved however not up to the mark.
